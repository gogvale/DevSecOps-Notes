[CALMS](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/calms-framework), as explained in the Atlassian post, is a framework that assesses a company's ability to adopt DevOps processes.

## Culture
For any DevOps adoption to be successful, an organisation will have to make a culture shift. Rather than the slower, full-release approach of the waterfall model, teams will have to adopt new strategies to **break projects into smaller tasks** that can be completed and then presented in a **series of sprints**.

## Automationï»¿
It is better to spend some time creating **automated processes** that can ensure that new feature integrations can occur in a reliable and repeatable manner.

## Lean
By implementing DevOps, we want to make sure that **tasks are broken as small as possible.** This method also allows our user base to provide feedback and a wishlist of features for the application.

## Measurement
When implementing DevOps, it is important to have some sort of measure of effectiveness. These metrics are important since they will help us make small changes to our processes and ensure that we are **constantly improving**.

Some examples are:
- <abbr title="MeanTime to Production">MTTP</abbr> ([Link](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/delivery/metrics.html)). 
	- What is the turnaround time for newly committed source code?
- Frequency of deployment
	- What is the frequency of deployment of releases? 
	- The average lead time. 
	- How long does it take to develop, build, test, and deploy a new feature?
- Speed of deployment
	- A new release is deployed into production; how long does it take?
- Deployment Agility
	- You can measure deployment agility by combining deployment speed and frequency.
- Production failure rate
	- How often do failures occur in production?
- <abbr title="Mean Time to Recover">MTTR</abbr>
	- What is the recovery time after a failure?
## Sharing
In an effective DevOps pipeline, there is a **shared responsibility** for the overall application between all teams, including development and operations. Understanding that all team members are required to deliver the final solution and share in the responsibility to do so will result in a better product for users.
