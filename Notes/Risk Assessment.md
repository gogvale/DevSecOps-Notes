Risk refers to the likelihood of a threat being exploited, negatively impacting a resource or the target it affects. Like checking if your bank app could be hacked, and how bad it would be if it was.

The idea is to perform risk assessments early in the software planning stages to avoid costly issues later; the earlier, the cheaper.

# Performing a Risk Assessment

## Assume Attack

1. Think about how hackers might attack and what makes your software a target (like valuable data or wide usage).
2. Decide what's an acceptable level of risk. For instance, losing customer data might cost millions, but fixing all bugs might cost $40,000.
## Risk Evaluation

1. Imagine the worst-case scenario if your software is attacked.
2. Determine the value of the data at risk and how hard it is to attack.
3. Consider how many users could be affected and how easily the software can be accessed by attackers.

## Select Evaluation Type
### Qualitative

`Risk = Severity x Likelihood`
In this case, we have can categorize risks as "Low," "Medium," or "High."

### Quantitative

In this case, we measure risks with numbers instead of categories.

**Example:** Assigning points to risks, like saying a critical bug is worth 5 points. Calculating the cost if data is leaked and balancing that against security costs.
