# Definition

DAST simulates real-world attacks on a web application to uncover potential security weaknesses. It actively interacts with the application, sending malicious requests and analyzing the responses for signs of vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.
# Benefits of DAST

- **Improved Security:** DAST helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Early Detection:** Automating DAST within CI/CD pipelines enables early detection and remediation of vulnerabilities.
- **Reduced Risk:** Proactive vulnerability scanning helps reduce the risk of security breaches.

# Manual DAST with OWASP ZAP

- **[[OWASP-ZAP]]** (Zed Attack Proxy) is a popular open-source DAST tool.
- ZAP allows manual testing where you can configure and launch targeted attacks against the application.
- You can analyze the application's behavior and responses to identify vulnerabilities.

# Automated DAST with Jenkins and Docker

- **Jenkins** is a popular continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool.
- **Docker** provides containerization for applications.
- We can leverage Jenkins pipelines to automate DAST scans at the end of the development pipeline.
- By integrating tools like ZAP within Docker containers, we can achieve automated vulnerability scanning as part of the deployment process, helping to catch vulnerabilities early.
