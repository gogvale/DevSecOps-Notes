# Importance

Security assessments are super important in the <abbr title="Software Development Life Cycle">SDLC</abbr>. Think of them as check-ups for your software to find and fix security problems. These assessments help make sure that everything is safe before the software is fully up and running. They are usually done at the end of the development process, in the Operations and Maintenance phase, to make sure all the final pieces are secure.

# Types of Assessment[]()
## Vulnerability Assessment

**What It Is:**
- Like a basic health check-up for your software.
- It looks for potential problems but doesn't go deep into proving how dangerous they are.

**How It Works:**
- Uses automated tools to scan the network and systems.
- Tools like OpenVAS, Nessus (Tenable), and ISS Scanner check ports, services, and software versions for known issues.
- The result is a report listing all the found problems with a severity rating (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

| **Pros**                               | **Cons**                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities | Can generate a large number of reports                                   |
| Part of the Penetration Test process     | Quality depends on the tool used                                         |
| More budget-friendly                    | Doesn't simulate real-world attack scenarios                             |

## Penetration Testing

**What It Is:**
- Like a full-on stress test for your software.
- It not only finds potential problems but also tries to exploit them to see how bad they can really be.

**How It Works:**
- Testers try to break into the system using the vulnerabilities found.
- They check if they can escalate privileges or access sensitive information.
- Provides a detailed report showing the real risks and suggests ways to fix them.

| **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Shows real-world risks                            | Very expensive                               |
| Demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be exploited | Requires extensive planning and time         |
| Provides actionable remediation steps             | May disrupt normal operations during testing |
