You can follow different methodologies to integrate security in the <abbr title="Software Development Life Cycle">SDLC</abbr> best. Regardless of the chosen development methodology (Agile, DevOps, Extreme Waterfall, etc.), there is a need to:

- **Build with security in mind**: Consider security from the start of software development.
- **Introduce testing focused on security**: Incorporate security testing throughout the development lifecycle.

# Microsoft's SDL

Microsoft's SDL emphasizes security principles throughout the software development lifecycle:

- **Secure by Design**: Build security into the software lifecycle from the beginning.
- **Security by Default**: Minimize potential harm caused by attackers by default.
- **Secure in Deployment**: Provide tools and guidance to support secure deployment.
- **Communications**: Maintain open communication about threats with users and administrators.

# OWASP's S-SDLC

OWASP's S-SDLC integrates security into each phase of software development using an Agile approach:

- **Security Quality Gates**: Implement security checks throughout the development pipeline.
- **Agile Security**: Dedicate sprints to security tasks like code reviews, authentication, and input validation.
- **Influenced by SAMM**: Based on the <abbr title="Software Assurance Maturity Model">SAMM</abbr> to assess and improve software security practices.

# SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)

SAMM helps organizations build and implement a software security strategy:

- **Maturity Model**: Evaluates current security practices and guides improvements.
- **Objective-driven**: Defines actions, metrics, and costs to enhance security.
- **Security Scorecard**: Provides gap analysis and measures security effectiveness.

# BSIMM (Building Security In Maturity Model)

BSIMM is a study of real-world software security initiatives:

- **Measurement Tool**: Assesses and compares an organization's security practices.
- **Reflects Industry Practices**: Shows what other companies are doing in terms of security.
- **Benchmarking Tool**: Helps understand and improve the security posture based on industry standards.
